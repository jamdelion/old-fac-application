# FAC Application (old)
This was my one-page website for the Founders &amp; Coders application pre-requisites.

I applied with this website originally for the summer 2019 cohort (offered an interview but turned it down because I'd accepted a job).

I later successfully re-applied in Spring 2020, but was unable to take the place due to the long notice period in my job.
